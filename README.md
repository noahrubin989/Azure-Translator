# Azure Translator

## Overview
This repository deals with translating text with Azure AI Translator service - a service that can translate more than 100 languages and dialects.

## Provisioning an Azure AI Translator resource
To use the Azure AI Translator service, you must provision a resource for it in your Azure subscription. You can provision a single-service Azure AI Translator resource, or you can use the Text Analytics API in a multi-service Azure AI Services resource. In this example I use a single-service Azure AI Translator resource.
